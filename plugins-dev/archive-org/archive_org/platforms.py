"""Archive.org `metadata.emulator` -> RomM platform slug.

**This table is the only thing standing between an import and a ROM filed
under the wrong system**, so it is an exact-match lookup with no fallback.
An emulator that is not spelled out below raises "needs mapping" and the
import stops. That is deliberate: a visible gap is cheap to close, and a
silently misfiled ROM is not, because nothing about the library afterwards
says anything went wrong.

Two temptations were considered and rejected:

* **Prefix rules.** Archive.org's emulator strings have an obvious
  family/variant shape -- `vice-resid`, `vice-pet`, `pce-macplus`,
  `pce-atarist-color`, `apple2ee-helper` -- and a rule like "split on the
  first hyphen" would map most of them for free. It would also map
  `vice-pet` to the C64 and `pce-atarist-color` to a Mac, because in both
  families the variant *is* the machine. The families are not hierarchies,
  so the shortcut is wrong exactly where it looks most useful.
* **Falling back to `dos`,** or to anything else, for an unknown emulator.
  That is the misfiling this table exists to prevent.

The keys were sampled from live Archive.org (2,000 items across
`collection:(softwarelibrary) AND emulator:[* TO *]`, ~220k items total),
so they are what the corpus actually contains rather than what an
emulator list suggests it might. The values were checked against RomM
4.9.2's own platform-slug enum -- a slug RomM does not know would fail
later, at `platform_id()`, with a much less useful message.

**The console half was measured, not guessed.** Every `emulator` value in
the Console Living Room was counted -- 132 distinct values over 24,746
items -- and the rows below marked *(CLR)* were added from that census
with the item count they answer for. Two things follow from having the
whole distribution rather than a sample:

* The console ids are **flat**, unlike the home-computer families the
  paragraph above warns about. `megadriv`, `megadrij` and `genesis` are
  one machine under three spellings; `gameboy`, `gbcolor` and `gba` are
  three machines under three spellings. Neither is a hierarchy, so each
  one is still written out.
* A `p`/`j` suffix is a **region**, not a machine: `nesp` and `nespal` are
  a PAL NES, `smsj` is a Japanese Master System, `a2600p` a PAL 2600.
  RomM has one slug per machine, so they all land on it.

Emulators deliberately left out surface as "needs mapping", which is the
correct answer until someone decides where they should land:

* **Ambiguous targets.** `ruffle-swf` (Flash), `cloudpilot-*` (PalmOS),
  `v86` (a JavaScript x86 that boots whatever you give it).
* **Machines RomM has no slug for**, checked against the slugs the other
  plugins in this catalogue already file to: `bally` (Bally Astrocade,
  20 items), `apfm1000` (APF MP-1000, 15), `socrates` (VTech Socrates, 8),
  `sv8000` (Bandai Super Vision 8000, 7), `gamepock` (Epoch Game Pocket
  Computer, 11), `fgtlayer` (4). A mapping cannot be invented for a
  platform the library does not have.
* **MAME romset names.** About 60 values -- `galaxian`, `mspacman`,
  `outrun`, `tmnt2`, `bublbobl` and so on -- each carried by one or two
  items, ~120 items in total. They are almost certainly `arcade`, and
  "almost certainly" is not the standard this table is held to: the key
  is a *game* id rather than a *machine* id, so the family cannot be
  closed by inspection and each would have to be verified individually.
  `mame` itself is mapped, and these are not it.
* **Composite values.** `gameboy,gb` and
  `dosbox,dosbox_drive_d,emularity_win31/win31.zip` are one item each and
  are an emulator id with a loader configuration appended. Splitting on
  the comma is exactly the prefix rule this table refuses.
* **`genisis`** -- one item, and a misspelling of `genesis` rather than a
  machine. Mapping a typo teaches the table to accept typos.
