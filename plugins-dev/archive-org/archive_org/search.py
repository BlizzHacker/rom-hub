"""Archive.org search, at the scale of a whole collection.

Two things this has to be at once: a search box, and a way to enumerate
24,746 items. `index.py` holds the part that makes the second possible --
`advancedsearch.php` will not page past 10,000 results but will answer any
size in one request if you do not ask it for a page -- and the reasoning
for reaching collection scale that way rather than through Archive.org's
scrape API is written down there.

What this module adds on top:

**`platform` is honoured, and it is a RomM slug.** It used to be ignored,
and `SearchResult.platform` used to be set to Archive.org's own emulator
id -- so a caller filtering on `genesis` got nothing back that it could
use, and a caller reading the field got `megadriv`. Both go through
`platforms.py` now: asking for `genesis` searches
`emulator:("genesis" OR "megadriv" OR "megadrij")`, because those are
three spellings of one machine, and every result names the RomM slug. A
platform this source has nothing under fails visibly rather than quietly
widening to everything.

**Collections are configurable, and the default now reaches the
consoles.** It was `["softwarelibrary"]`, which is the Archive's
*software* umbrella and does not contain the Console Living Room. That is
measured, not assumed: `softwarelibrary` holds 250,382 items,
`consolelivingroom` holds 24,746, and **212** items are in both. So out
of the box this plugin could not see a single Mega Drive cartridge. The
default is now both collections; an operator who wants one of them says
so, and any other Archive.org collection works the same way.

**`stream_only` is carried, not filtered.** Archive.org marks the items it
will only play in a browser, and 6,816 of the collection's 24,746 are
marked. Those are not junk: they are the `stream` capability's whole
population, and dropping them from search would put that capability out
of reach. `downloadable_only` exists for the operator who is bulk
importing and does not want to be shown items the importer will refuse.

#: `protocol.MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS` caps an RPP frame at 8 MiB, and a
#: `SearchResult` from this plugin serialises to 467-602 characters --
#: measured over two captured pages, the larger figure being the one with
#: long titles and four-entry collection lists. 8 MiB / 602 is about
#: 13,900, so 12,000 leaves a real margin. Verified from the other side
#: too: 11,893 results (every downloadable Mega Drive item) came back
#: intact, and asking for all 24,746 did not -- it exceeded the frame,
#: which the host reports as *"the stream is now desynchronised and the
#: peer must be killed"*.
#:
#: Asking for more is **refused**, not quietly truncated. Truncation would
#: answer "how big is this collection" with a number this plugin made up,
#: and the operator would have no way to tell. The refusal names the two
#: knobs that make the ask fit.
