"""Reading Archive.org's index at collection scale, and what that costs.

`search.py` used to send one `advancedsearch.php` request with `rows=limit`
and `page=1`. That is fine for a search box and useless for a collection:
the Console Living Room holds **24,746 items**, and nothing in the plugin
could see past the first page of them.

Getting the rest is not a matter of asking for more pages. The four
findings that shape this module are written down here rather than left to
be discovered again by the next person -- and note that only the first
two are about Archive.org. The limit that actually decides the shape of
this code is the Hub's own, in section 3.

## 1. `page` is what imposes the ceiling, not `rows`

`advancedsearch.php` refuses to page deeper than 10,000 results::

    rows=100  page=101  -> {"error": "[DEEP_PAGING] Requested results would
                            exceed the deep paging limit for this service,
                            10000 results; ..."}
    rows=1000 page=11   -> the same
    rows=2000 page=6    -> the same

and the error text itself names the way out: *"You may request any number
of results at one time if you do NOT specify any page."* Measured against
the live service::

    q=collection:(consolelivingroom) AND emulator:("genesis")
      AND NOT collection:(stream_only)
    rows=11000, no page  ->  10,045 docs in ~2 seconds

So a bulk read omits `page` entirely. Whether one response is then enough
is a separate question, answered in section 3. `page` is still used for
small asks, where it is the natural resume point -- see `Index.fetch`.

## 2. The scrape API is the documented answer and the wrong one

`/services/search/v1/scrape` is what that error message points at, and it
does work: cursor-paged, it returned all 24,746 items of the collection in
137 seconds over 25 pages of 1,000 -- with each successive page slower
than the last (3.5s early, 9.5s at the end). It has two disqualifying
properties.

**It does not apply a field filter.** Asked for
`collection:(consolelivingroom) AND emulator:("genesis")` on a fresh
connection it answered `total=24746` -- the whole collection -- and the
first page came back 36 genesis, 20 nes, 12 a2600, 5 gbcolor. The
`emulator:` clause is silently dropped. Every one of 33 per-emulator
queries returned the identical first 100 identifiers. A filter that is
accepted and ignored is worse than one that is rejected, because the
caller gets a plausible answer to a question it did not ask.

**Its result set is not reliably the one you asked for.** Consecutive
requests on one keep-alive connection returned each other's totals:
`collection:(nasa)` and `collection:(consolelivingroom)` both answered
`total=208822` in one run and both answered `total=24746` in another,
depending only on which query had been sent first.

Neither of those is a thing to build a plugin's idea of "the collection"
on, and both were reproduced from this workstation more than once. The
scrape endpoint is therefore **not used**. That is a finding about
Archive.org, not a preference, and it is why this module reaches
collection scale through `advancedsearch.php` alone.

## 3. The host caps a response at 4 MiB, and that is the real ceiling

Neither of the limits above is what actually stops a plugin reading a
whole collection. `ctx.http` is an RPC and the host refuses a response
over `broker.fetcher.MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`::

    ResponseTooLarge: response from 'https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php'
    exceeded the 4194304-byte limit at 4198942 bytes; bulk transfer is a
    host concern, not a ctx.http one

That is the right rule -- an untrusted subprocess must not be able to ask
the host to buffer arbitrary amounts -- so the plugin is what has to fit
inside it. Two measurements decide how, taken against the 11,893
downloadable Mega Drive items:

    7 fields incl. notes   5,482,997 bytes   461 bytes/doc   over
    6 fields, no notes     3,093,609 bytes   260 bytes/doc   under
    5 fields               1,827,164 bytes   154 bytes/doc

So `notes` -- the control boilerplate, ~400 characters of it repeated on
every Mega Drive item -- is nearly half the payload. It is asked for only
while the result set is small enough to afford it; past that the
`has_controls` flag on a search result goes quiet rather than the search
failing, and `metadata` still reads the field per item.

And past ~14,000 documents even the lean field set will not fit, which is
why `_collect` **partitions the query** rather than paging it. `item_size`
is indexed, is present on all 24,746 items of the collection (checked:
`NOT item_size:[* TO *]` matches zero), and a numeric range splits any
query into two disjoint halves that between them lose nothing. Bisect
until each half fits, then read each half with one page-less request.
That is the only shape that gets past 10,000 *and* stays under 4 MiB,
because `page` cannot reach past 10,000 and the page-less form has no
offset to chunk with.

## 4. Be a considerate client

Everything here is a GET against a free public service that rate-limits,
so: responses are cached for the life of the process (`Index` is
constructed once per capability call, and one `search()` that pages will
hit the cache rather than re-ask), failures back off rather than retry
immediately, and a request that fails twice **halves `rows` and tries
again** -- a caller that asked for 20,000 and can be given 5,000 is better
served than one given an exception.

    term into Archive.org's *default* field -- effectively the whole
    record, description and subject tags and uploader notes included --
    and then let relevance ranking sort it out. It did not sort it out.
    Searching `sonic` returned `Die Hard (2004)(Die Chefrocker)`;
    `oregon trail` returned `Great Hierophant's .WOZ Archive`;
    `prince of persia` returned `Total Replay`. Those items match
    somewhere in their metadata, which is not a claim anybody searching a
    ROM library is making.

    So each term is required to appear **in the title**, and all of them
    must:

        title:("prince" AND "of" AND "persia") AND collection:(softwarelibrary)

    Two deliberate choices about how far to narrow:

    **Terms, not a phrase.** `title:("prince of persia")` also fixes the
    junk, but it demands adjacency and word order -- verified live, it
    returns *zero* results for `hedgehog sonic` and `persia prince`, while
    the AND-of-terms form answers both with the Sonic and Prince of Persia
    titles. A search that silently returns nothing because the words were
    typed in a different order is a worse bug than the one being fixed.

    **Title only, not title-or-identifier.** Checked live: adding
    `identifier:(...)` changed essentially nothing, because an
    Archive.org identifier already echoes the title. It is complexity
    that buys no recall.

    An empty query drops the clause entirely rather than emitting
    `title:()`, which is a syntax error, or `title:("")`, which matches
    nothing -- browsing a collection has to stay possible, and browsing
    is the whole point of a collection-scale read.

    `emulators` narrows to Archive.org's own machine ids and
    `downloadable_only` drops the `stream_only` half of the collection.
    Both are clauses Archive.org's *advancedsearch* honours; neither
    survives the scrape API, which is one of the reasons this module does

        **Why a rank lookup rather than a bisection on the size range.**
        Bisecting `[0, 2**42]` is the obvious implementation and is far too
        slow: item sizes are heavily skewed small, so the first fifteen
        splits all put the entire corpus in the lower half, and each one

        -- `sort[]=item_size asc, rows=1, page=N` -- costs one request and
