"""What Archive.org knows about how a game is controlled, and no more.

An Archive.org item that can be emulated in the browser has to tell the
reader which key is which console button, because the reader is holding a
keyboard and the game expects a joypad. That information is real, and it
is worth carrying into the library: a rom imported here plays in RomM's
own EmulatorJS player, which is the same keyboard-shaped problem.

**This module was written after measuring what is there, not before.**
Every count below is from a live census of the Console Living Room
(24,746 items), because the shape of the answer decides what may honestly
be carried.

## The three fields, and what each one actually is

`metadata.controller` -- **structured, and rare.** 405 items, every one
of them Atari 2600, and the whole vocabulary is four words::

    joystick  368     paddle  32     keypad  4     driving  1

This is the only genuinely structured control data in the collection. It
is carried verbatim.

`metadata.emulator_instructions` -- **prose, and trustworthy.** 1,818
items, and across all of them just **eight distinct texts**, one per
machine: Master System (553), Atari 2600 (514), Game Gear (427),
ColecoVision (234), SG-1000 (72), Super A'Can (9), Socrates (8),
Arcadia (1). Every one of the eight is a control description. It is
Archive.org's own field for exactly this, so it is carried whenever it is
present, with no test applied.

That last clause is a finding rather than laziness. Running
`is_control_text` over all eight rejects two of them -- Socrates
(*"included a full keyboard attachment, and so most keys should work"*)
and Arcadia (*"press the '1' key ... Press the arrow keys to move around
the bug"*) -- both of which plainly are control instructions written
without the word "button" or "joystick". A field whose entire population
is control text does not need a test, and applying one there would only
lose nine items.

`metadata.notes` -- **prose, mostly control boilerplate, not always.**
14,317 items. Of 4,000 sampled there were 72 distinct texts, and the ten
largest are per-machine control boilerplate covering ~99% of the
sample -- Mega Drive (3,343), Atari 7800 (218), WonderSwan (114), Atari
5200 (71), Intellivision (70), TurboGrafx-16 (67), Neo Geo Pocket (36).
The tail is not: `notes` is also where an uploader writes *"Unofficial
boxart by me"* or explains that a file is a WASM-4 cartridge. So `notes`
is carried **only when it reads as control text** -- see `is_control_text`
-- and the blob records that it was `notes` it came from, so a reader can
discount it.

## What this deliberately does not do

**It does not parse the prose into a key -> button table.** The
boilerplates look parseable -- *"There are three buttons, A, B and C,
which are CONTROL, ALT/OPTION and SPACE"* -- and a parser for the ten
common ones could be written. It would then be a table this plugin
invented, sitting in a field that says it came from Archive.org, and the
first uploader to reword a sentence would turn it into a wrong table
rather than a missing one. Archive.org publishes sentences; this carries
sentences.

**It does not fill in a machine's mapping from a sibling item.** The
boilerplate really is per-emulator, and copying the Mega Drive text onto
the 175 Mega Drive items that lack it would be defensible right up until
one of them is the item whose controls differ. An item with no control
text yields no control blob, and `MetadataPatch` reads an absent field as
"leave the library alone".

So the honest summary of coverage, on the collection this was measured
against: **16,127 of 24,746 items carry at least one of the three fields**
-- and per machine it swings from ~98% of the Mega Drive to 1 of 219 for
the SNES. A rom that gets no control blob is the normal case for several
platforms, and that is a fact about Archive.org rather than a gap here.
