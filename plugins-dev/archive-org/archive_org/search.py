"""Archive.org search over the advancedsearch.php scraping API.

`collection` is requested up front so stream-only items can be flagged
without a second round trip: Archive.org marks non-downloadable items by
putting them in the `stream_only` collection, and that flag is what decides
whether a later phase offers import or streaming.

**Queries are scoped to the title.** See `build_query` -- this was a real
relevance bug, not a preference.

def build_query(query: str | None, collections: list[str]) -> str:
    '''The advancedsearch `q`, with the user's terms confined to the title.

    This used to be `({query}) AND collection:({scope})`, which put a bare
    term into Archive.org's *default* field -- effectively the whole record,
    description and subject tags and uploader notes included -- and then let
    relevance ranking sort it out. It did not sort it out. Searching `sonic`
    returned `Die Hard (2004)(Die Chefrocker)`; `oregon trail` returned
    `Great Hierophant's .WOZ Archive` and `A2R Images`; `prince of persia`
    returned `Total Replay` and `Monmallineun Tarokbeom`. Those items match
    somewhere in their metadata, which is not a claim anybody searching a ROM
    library is making.

    So each term is required to appear **in the title**, and all of them must:

        title:("prince" AND "of" AND "persia") AND collection:(softwarelibrary)

    Two deliberate choices about how far to narrow:

    **Terms, not a phrase.** `title:("prince of persia")` also fixes the
    junk, but it demands adjacency and word order -- verified live, it
    returns *zero* results for `hedgehog sonic` and `persia prince`, while
    the AND-of-terms form answers both with the Sonic and Prince of Persia
    titles. A search that silently returns nothing because the words were
    typed in a different order is a worse bug than the one being fixed.

    **Title only, not title-or-identifier.** Checked live: adding
    `identifier:(...)` changed essentially nothing, because an Archive.org
    identifier already echoes the title. It is complexity that buys no
    recall.

    An empty query drops the clause entirely rather than emitting
    `title:()`, which is a syntax error, or `title:("")`, which matches
    nothing -- browsing a collection has to stay possible.
