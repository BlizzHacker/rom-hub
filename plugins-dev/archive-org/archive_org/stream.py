"""Archive.org `stream`: point a player at an item that can be played.

The routing signal is the same one the importer uses, read the other way
round. Archive.org marks items it will only play in a browser by putting
them in the `stream_only` collection; the importer refuses those, and this
is what makes that refusal a redirection rather than a dead end -- the
game is playable, just not downloadable.

An emulated Archive.org item plays at its own details page, which loads
Emularity in the browser. So the target is a URL on `archive.org`, inside
the same allowlist everything else this plugin returns is inside, and the
host checks it before handing it on.

What this deliberately does not do is invent a media URL. Archive.org
serves the *item*, not a stream; anything shaped like a direct video or
audio endpoint would be a fabrication, and a plugin that fabricates a
target is a plugin whose refusals cannot be believed either.
